# Software Engineering Fundamentals COMP1531 2022 Term 3

## Course Summary

This course is teaches students about software engineering principles via exposure to the important practice of building correct products in effectively functioning teams.

You will be exposed to agile software practices, team collaboration and effective communication through implementing a group project based on agile software methodologies that requires you to analyse, design, build and deploy a web-based application. This course is typically taken in soon after completing COMP1511, but could be delayed and taken later. It provides essential background for the teamwork and project management required in many later courses.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate effective use of applying the software development to build full-stack end-user applications
- Demonstrate effective use of static testing, dynamic testing, and user testing to validate and verify software systems
- Understand key characteristics of a functioning team in terms of understanding professional expectations, maintaining healthy relationships, and managing conflict.
- Demonstrate an ability to analyse complex software systems in terms of their data model, state model, and more.
- Understand the software engineering life cycle in the context of modern and iterative software development practices in order to elicit requirements, design systems thoughtfully, and implement software correctly.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how to use version control, continuous integration, and deployment tooling to sustainably integrate code from multiple parties
